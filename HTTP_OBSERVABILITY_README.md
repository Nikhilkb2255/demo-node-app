# 🚀 HTTP Observability Integration Complete

## ✅ What's Been Added

This repository now includes HTTP-based observability that sends data to a centralized backend:

### 📁 New Files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Simplified setup for HTTP transmission
- `monitoring/http-observability-setup.js` - Winston + Prometheus + Jaeger + HTTP setup
- `monitoring/http-transmission-client.js` - HTTP client for sending data
- `monitoring/config.js` - Configuration for HTTP transmission
- `start-with-http-observability.sh` - Easy startup script
- `.env` - Environment configuration (manual creation required)

### 🔄 HTTP Observability Pipeline:
```
Logs: App → Winston → HTTP → Backend → OpenSearch
Metrics: App → Prometheus Client → HTTP → Backend → OpenSearch
Traces: App → Jaeger Client → HTTP → Backend → OpenSearch
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in your application directory with the following content:

```bash
# HTTP Observability Configuration
BACKEND_URL=http://your-backend-server:3002
HTTP_TRANSMISSION_ENABLED=true
OBSERVABILITY_API_KEY=your-api-key
ORGANISATION_ID=your-org-id
PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REPOSITORY_URL=your-repo-url

# Service Configuration
SERVICE_NAME=abc-test-node
SERVICE_VERSION=1.0.0
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
# Option 1: Using the startup script
./start-with-http-observability.sh

# Option 2: Manual startup
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Using Docker
```bash
# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📊 What You'll See

- **Automatic data transmission** to the backend via HTTP
- **Real-time logs, metrics, and traces** sent to OpenSearch
- **Centralized monitoring** in the backend infrastructure
- **No local observability stack** required (Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger, Grafana)

## 🔄 Send Data to Backend

### Automatic Data Pipeline
```bash
# Data is automatically sent via HTTP when you:
# 1. Start your application
# 2. Make HTTP requests
# 3. Generate logs, metrics, or traces
```

### Access Backend Services
- **Backend API**: ${BACKEND_URL}
- **OpenSearch Dashboards**: Check your backend for OpenSearch URL
- **Health Check**: ${BACKEND_URL}/health

## 📝 Commands

```bash
# Start application
npm start

# View logs
npm start

# Stop application
Ctrl+C

# Using Docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f app
docker-compose down
```

## ✅ Benefits of HTTP Transmission

1. **No Local Infrastructure** - No need for Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger, Grafana
2. **Centralized Monitoring** - All data in one backend
3. **Scalable** - Multiple applications can send to one backend
4. **Reliable** - Retry logic, circuit breaker, batch processing
5. **Simple Setup** - Just install dependencies and start

Your application now has HTTP-based observability with automatic data transmission to the centralized backend!
